Face Detection using SSD

This is a Python script that detects faces in real-time using the SSD (Single Shot Detector) deep learning model. It uses the OpenCV library to capture video from the default camera on your computer.
Prerequisites

Before running this script, you will need to install the following libraries:

    OpenCV
    NumPy

You can install these libraries using pip. For example:

pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy

Usage

To run the script, simply execute the following command:

python face_detection_ssd.py

This will start the video capture and display the output in a window. The script will continue to run until you press the 'q' key to quit.
Acknowledgments

This script was adapted from the OpenCV tutorial on face detection using the SSD deep learning model. You can find the tutorial and more information on the OpenCV website.
